	\section dep Dependencies

	The following libraries must be built and in the paths in order to build properly:

	-  ROOT
		-  <a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/">ROOT Website</a> 
		- Required for file input and output
	-  Geant4
		- <a href="http://geant4.cern.ch/">Geant4 Website</a>
		- Required for the simulation libraries
		- Requires use of the following libraries:
			- G4EMLOW6.32
